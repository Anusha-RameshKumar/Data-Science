Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, and automate decision-making in various applications. Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are its main approaches, each suited for different tasks. Today, ML powers technologies such as recommendation systems, image recognition, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles. By continuously learning from new data, machine learning helps organizations make smarter decisions, improve efficiency, and innovate across industries.
